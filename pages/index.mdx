# Introduction
 
VisualVocal bridges the gap between spoken and signed communication, utilizing real-time speech recognition and robotic hands to transform spoken words into expressive sign language gestures. This Arduino-powered project fosters inclusivity by breathing life into sign language, offering a glimpse into a future where everyone can understand the language of the heart. :)

## What is Visual Vocal?

A **cutting-edge** project where expressive __sign language__ is brought to life by two robotic hands and a microphone, seamlessly translating spoken commands into gestures.
